# CS 170 Project Spring 2020

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `utils.py`: contains functions to compute cost and validate NetworkX graphs
- `solver.py`: contains all the code we have
  To solve a specific input, type the input name into the string file_list (e.g. file_list = "small-1") , and run "python ./solver.py" in the terminal.
  For multiple inputs, put them in the same string separated by commas (e.g. file_list = "small-1, large-2"), and run the same command in the terminal. 
- `solver.ipynb`: contains the exact same code as `solver.py`, so that things can be run in jupyter notebook. 
  To solve for inputs, type the input name in the same way as for `solver.py` and then simply run the cell.
